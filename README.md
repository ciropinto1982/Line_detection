# Line_detection
This folder contains my codes that perform line detection for X-ray spectra of astronomical objects using the software SPEX (a UV / X-ray fitting package developed at SRON). It can be adapted to different data, software and platforms. Do not e=hesitate to contact me for more information and support to implement it or adapting to different fitting packages and data.

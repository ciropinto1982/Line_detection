# Spectral fitting
This folder contains my codes that perform broadband modelling and line detection of X-ray spectra of astronomical objects using the software SPEX (a UV / X-ray fitting package developed at SRON). It can be adapted to different data, software and platforms. Do not hesitate to contact me for more information and support to implement it or adapting to different fitting packages and data.

- SPEX_fit_example.com is a simple SPEX executable that can be edited and then loaded into SPEX typing "log exe SPEX_fit_example". This loads a data spectrum, creates the model and fits the model to the data and plots them all.

- Convert-spectra-to-SPEX-format directory contains a few simple examples that run TRAFO auxiliary task of SPEX directly from command line or via shell scripts in order to convert standard OGIP FITS spectra to SPEX format.

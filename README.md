# Spectral fitting
This folder contains my codes that perform broadband modelling and line detection of X-ray spectra of astronomical objects using the software SPEX (a UV / X-ray fitting package developed at SRON). It can be adapted to different data, software and platforms. Do not hesitate to contact me for more information and support to implement it or adapting to different fitting packages and data.

- SPEX_fit_example.com is a simple SPEX executable that can be edited and then loaded into SPEX via "log exe SPEX_fit_example"

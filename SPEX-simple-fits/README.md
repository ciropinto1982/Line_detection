# Tutorial for SPEX basic spectral fits

This is a work-in-progress directory that contains simple example of how to perform basic spectral fits with SPEX.

- "SPEX_fit_example_XRB.com" shows how to fit the X-ray spectrum (e.g. XMM/EPIC-pn) of a bright X-ray source, such as an X-ray binary or ULX found in a nearby (1.9 Mpc) galaxy, assuming a powerlaw continuum corrected for redshift and interstellar absorption.

Source name: V2491 Cygni, Observation ID: 0552270501, Download spectra: RGS (PPS)

3) Convert OGIP-FITS spectra and responses to SPEX SPO/RES format with TRAFO

./TRAFO_FITS_to_SPEX_convert.sh

4) Open the spectra to plot them in SPEX

BASH script: ./SPEX_plot_example_bash.sh

SPEX script: log exe SPEX_plot_example_spex (.com is removed)

or open SPEX and copy/paste individual commands

5) Open, plot and fit spectra with SPEX

SPEX script: log exe SPEX_fits_example_spex (.com is removed)

or open SPEX and copy/paste individual commands

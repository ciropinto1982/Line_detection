# SPEX tutorial to fit complex and line-rich RGS spectra of novae and supersoft sources

0) Download SPEX from link below. Youâ€™ll need XQUARTZ or X11 for plotting windows.

   The link will provide installer, manuals and cookbooks.

2) Download RGS data from XMM-XSA website

http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/#search

Source name: V2491 Cygni, Observation ID: 0552270501, Download spectra: RGS (PPS)

3) Convert OGIP-FITS spectra and responses to SPEX SPO/RES format with TRAFO

./TRAFO_FITS_to_SPEX_convert.sh

4) Open the spectra to plot them in SPEX

BASH script: ./SPEX_plot_example_bash.sh

SPEX script: log exe SPEX_plot_example_spex (.com is removed)

or open SPEX and copy/paste individual commands

5) Open, plot and fit spectra with SPEX

SPEX script: log exe SPEX_fits_example_spex (.com is removed)

or open SPEX and copy/paste individual commands
